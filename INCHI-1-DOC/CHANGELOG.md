## v1.06 2020-12-20

### Added

- Zz pseudoelement atoms both in polymeric and general-placeholder context Option `NPZZ` to allow non-polymer Zz atoms (polymeric ones are allowed by default by Polymers switch)
- Option `Polymers105` to emulate v. 1.05 treatment of polymers
- Support of simultaneous presence of both source-based and structure-based subunits in copolymer unit (per request of Gerd Blanke, StructurePendium)
- Option `NoFrameShift` (disables frame shift for all CRU's), works for both inchi-1 and API
- In-CRU inner repeats are performed if the switch `FoldCRU` is specified (so *-(CH2CH2)n-* is converted to *-(CH2)n-* and so on)
- Switch `NoEDits` disables both frame shift and CRU folding
- Option `SAtZz` enables stereo at atoms connected to Zz pseudo atoms (default: disabled/ignored)
- Switch `LooseTSACheck` relaxes strictness of tetrahedral stereo ambiguity check for stereo atoms in cycles (useful for dealing with large cycles 'cleaned' by some software), per request from FDA
- Switch `WMnumber` for InChI Library/inchi-1 (sets timeout in milliseconds, strictly requires long int number), per request from CDK folks
- `NoWarnings` option to inchi-1 and InChI Library: suppress warnings but keep error messages; useful for the long runs on multi-million record inputs
- Switch `MergeHash`: make combined InChIKey+extra hash(es) if present (inchi-1)
- Switch `PERTHREAD`:n allowing one to process n SDF records in each of mol2inchi threads.
- Use Tab as synonym to Tabbed, works for inchi-1
- API call `IXA_INCHIBUILDER_SetOption_Timeout_Milliseconds()`
- `IXA_MOL_GetBondOtherAtom()` exposed in the public API, as Paul Thiessen suggested
- API call `IXA_MOL_ReserveSpace()` (necessary in new mode `IXA_USES_SMART_ALLOCS`)
- More IXA API functionality for polymers (API calls `IXA_MOL_CreatePolymerUnit()`, `IXA_MOL_SetPolymerUnit()`, `IXA_MOL_GetPolymerUnitId()`, `IXA_MOL_GetPolymerUnitIndex()` )
- Made /inchi2inchi calc mode to treat InChI=1//
- Provided a simplistic example of multi-threaded boss-worker InChI generation into mol2inchi demo program (Linux pthreads/Windows threads are used)
- winchi-1: added SDF navigation by keyboard Ctrl-Lt, Ctrl-Rt arrows; Ctrl-G for Goto Compound #

### Changed

- Polymers with undefined ("star", or Zz) end-groups are represented with explicitly shown in InChI string Zz atoms. If CRU frame shift took place, bonding is changed accordingly
- In InChI part for any polymer CRU , the crossing bond printed first is now that pointing to more senior CRU end ("head")
- Returned value of `IXA_INCHIBUILDER_OPTION_LargeMolecules` to 11 as it was in v1.05 but 31 in v1.06pre3 (per request by Daniel Lowe)
- Improved performance of IXA memory allocations by using expandable arrays (per request by Daniel Lowe; see `#ifdef IXA_USES_SMART_ALLOCS`)
- Changed inchi-1 SDF ID value type to unsigned long to account for current CAS numbers which may now be > LONG MAX (thanks to DT for noticing)
- Made return codes of `GetInChIFrom...()` functions in case of InChI read error corresponding to what is declared in API description
- Changed `INFINITY` defined in chi_can2.c to `INCHI_CANON_INFINITY` to avoid collision with MS' INFINITY defined in VS 2015 math.h (pointed out by DT)
- Changed label of winchi-1 toolbar button "Write result" to more descriptive "Batch process all"
- Changed winchi-1 disk output behavior to avoid unnecessary writing, per ACD/Labs request . Now the program writes log/output/problem files disk only in batch mode, if not otherwise requested
- Now winchi-1 starts in maximized window.
- Made numerous small changes related to the refactoring of code

### Removed

- Removed function char `base26_checksum()` (as there is no check character in InChIKey anymore)
- Removed InChI2InChI test option of inchi-1 executable (use RTrip option of test_ixa demo app instead, or use API directly)

### Fixed (security)

- Fixed 22 possibly security-compromising issues found by Google-AutoFuzz of 2018-2019 (reported via SourceForge) mostly issues related to inadequate handling of invalid/artificial input on inchi2struct conversion that may result in memory corruption, etc.
- Fixed 102 more, then 1 more, possibly security-compromising issues found by Google- AutoFuzz of 2019 (reported by Ian Wetherbee), mostly issues related to inadequate handling of invalid/artificial input on inchi2struct conversion that may result in memory corruption, etc.; some are similar to/same as GAF22
- Fixed 19 more possibly security-compromising issues of 2020 found by google/oss-fuzz
- Fixed 4 possibly security-compromising issues of 2019 (reported by Cure53) issues found with AddressSanitizer, mostly related to inadequate handling of invalid/artificial input that may result in memory corruption, etc.

In particular, this fix repairs the issue reported by Lutz Weber, Ontochem, on 2020-03-03.

"The failure occurs when one of two or more constitutionally equivalent undefined stereocenters has been removed due to stereo equivalence of its two attachments." Thanks, DT!
- Fixed bug reported by Andrew Dalke and separately by Burt Leland: H isotope with insane mass difference has been silently consumed which sometimes resulted in memory corruption

- Fixed the case of erroneous behavior of inchi-1 with "/D" option Added treating of mistakenly overlooked case of zero bond number in MOL V3000 parser (thanks to Burt Leland)
- Fixed typo in ichirvr2.c#2838 and removed junk UTF symbols appeared due to copy-pasting from PDF
